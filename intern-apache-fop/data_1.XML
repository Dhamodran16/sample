				<title>Drive train</title>
				<para>The drive train is the group of components that are necessary for the operation of the bicycle. The drive train is the primary system for the movement of the bicycle. A typical drive train has the chain wheels, the chain, the pedals and the saddle.</para>
				<para>Since the drive train has many components, it is necessary to do a regular maintenance. The drive train maintenance is easy and the users can disassemble and assemble each part of the drive train. Because of this, when one part is defective, it is possible to remove and replace it with a new one.</para>

				<para>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</para>
